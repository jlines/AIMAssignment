Aim GIT task

The hello world document was useful for getting started in creating a repository in Github. 
Some GIT concepts can be challenging when getting started, the difference between merging and rebasing took me a while to get better at. 
One resource that I found to be very helpful when learning git was this website https://learngitbranching.js.org/?locale=en_US

Since the wifi at the school seems to block the SSH port I had to use HTTPS to work with the repo. In this case I had to use github access tokens which I had not used before. https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens

I also learned that you can create and update branches pretty easily right from the GH website, in the past I've always used git on my local machine
